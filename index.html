  <h1> Arturo C Valadez</h1>
  <p>
    Hey there, My name is Arturo C Valadez. I was born in Guadalajara, Mexico and raised in southern California. I am a US Navy veteran with a background in construction, contracting and logistics. I dropped out of a graphic design program when I was nineteen and now I am attending code-fellows bootcamp. My goal is to learn how to be a great software developer and immerse myself in the field of technology.
